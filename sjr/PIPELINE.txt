# Might want to sort (and index) both of the above output files at this point
# Can get rid of below sort command if sort here

# Group by 5' and 3' -- No need for this file after running the next command! (could pipeline)
sort -k1,1 -k2n,3n test_reads.bed | python group_introns.py - test_groups.bed

# Get the sequence of all the observed RS introns

Other useful commands
  grep 'AG\tGT'
  grep -v '\t1\t'

Left to do:
	get info about surrounding intron (i.e. the intron the RS introns occur in)
	evaluate what are halmarks of genuine RS events
